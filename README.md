# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### 1.To analyze the trend of the kickstarted outcome throughout the year from 2009 to 2017 from the perspective of different parent catagories.
### 2.To analyzed the relation of Outcome succesful, failed and canceled rate with amount of goal.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date: Use the pivot table, set the outcome as columns and date created conversion as rows with the outcome numbers setted as values to show the relation between the outcome and years launched. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals: use excel formula countifs to process the data and reach the result of relation bewteen successful failed and cancled percentage and the projet amount they want to raise. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered:during this process the setting of pivot table is the challenge because i need to figure out the logic behind the table and the chart and add the filter to get the required result.


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
to see the outcome from different years as a whole, for thearter industry usually mid year will have more amount of projects and also a higher rate of success. the calceled rate usually have a minor change throughout the year. the fail rate will also have a peak during the middle of the year.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Most of the project goal stays under $14,999. The projects with amount from $10,000 to 14,999 have the highest rate of fail. Projects goal of under $9,999 are more likely to sucesss.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The volumn of the dataset is limited in numbers

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
The successful rate of the projects from different categories can be put into one table for comparison.
The total number of projects for different categories can be summaried in a table to see which one have the most projects and which one have the least.
